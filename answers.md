Apps more widely used are naturally the ones with more ratings given; apps with best ratings will naturally tend to be less know and thus have fewer ratings given so it is easy to achieve higher classification; for a fair comparison we would have to define a minimum threshold or amount of votes or otherwise we are comparing two different realities

10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?

Head Soccer,5,481564
Plants vs. Zombies,5,426463

11. Does people care about the price?

From a pool of 7195 apps and ~93mill rates given, we can split them in the following:

avg rate for non paid apps = 3.4 with 80mill rates given from 4054 apps sampled (1.9K per app)
avg rate for paid apps = 3.7 with 12.6mill rates given from 3141 apps sampled (4K per app)

Considering this, we can see that there is an overall preference for free apps but that does not correlate with overall satisfaction which we can see tends to be more closely related with the paid ones
